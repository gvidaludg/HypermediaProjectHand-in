## Project Analysis

### Technology

I decided to use Bootstrap, to simplify the development of the responsive elements in the page. As well as having a template for the colors and design (I'm not particularly creative when it comes to web design).

### Target User Profile

The targets are companies that would want to hire a programmer. I feel like, when it comes to hiring developers the contents of the page are often more desirable than the design itself. I wanted to convey simplicity and lack of unnecessary details, efficiency, my job is to be like that.

### Information Architecture

I don't really know what this section means. I decided to do the first column with simple statements to be able to catch interest of the reader quickly, and then optionally expand on myself with the right one.

### Visual Design

The left column allows the user read common information quickly about me. While the second one, the main contents, contain longer more detailed information about who I am and what I do.
